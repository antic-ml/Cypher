# Cypher
A command line game that challenges you to break a Caesar cypher.

Can you decrypt the secret message to reveal what it says?
The message has been encrypted with a Caesar Shift.  A type of substitution
cipher in which each letter in the message is replaced by a letter some
fixed number of positions down the alphabet.  For example, with a left shift
of 3, D would be replaced by A, E would become B, and so on.
To decipher the message, substitute the letters. Be warned, the message is in Latin!
This is an engrossing game, but if you want to
quit,  type \"quit\".
